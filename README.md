# Make Change Project

### Description

-The process of creating this Java application help put into practice fundamentals of object-oriented based programming through Java. There is no real world application of this program and it was created for educational purposes.

It is a basic cash register application that will:

1. Ask for an Item Price
2. Ask for Amount Tendered
3. Print
    1. exact change if exact change is given
    2. error if not enough money given
    3. if change is needed, will suggest the amount of each type to be given in the correct english syntax
      1. for example pennies and penny will print correctly
          1. Amount: 1.98 Tendered: 5.0 Results: 3 Two Dollar Bills, 2 Pennies. `

- This program uses 3 methods.

method 1: Counts each Domination

method 2: Changes the remaining change amount

method 3: prints our results depending on the value of the int variable represent each of my money types




### Lessons Learned

- It is good not to have dry code that has to be re-entered repeated, using methods and loops are great to save from rewriting repeat code

- Java is pass by values not reference, values in a method won't change nor will values passed to method be stored or change outside of the method. You also have to pass variables matching parameters through a method. If you have method that returns something for example [public static double]. You have then re/assign that return value to a double variable in the main if you want it stored in main.

- Java isn't math. Doubles are not as perfect as I thought, there is not such thing as a perfect double. I used to think that programing was close to math but not that I see you can't even rely on a double. My thoughts have changed on this. I know there must be a better way / more accurate way to make a cash register that I'm sure we'll learn about soon. I had to type cast int from a double and it was inaccurate enough that I had to modify the value of a variable when addressing the count of the penny.

- methods have to be outside of the main {}

- A lot of ways to go about this project. Learning that there's never just one solution.

- I'm still at baby step 3 after this week. I need to learn to take more breaks. Screen time doesn't have mean progress.
